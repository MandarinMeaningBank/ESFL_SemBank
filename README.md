# ESFL SemBank
This repository includes the syntatico--semantic representations for sentences in English as a Second or Foreign Language (ESFL).

Here are a few details about the dataset:

- ESL refers to English as a Second Language data.
- CESL is the corrected version of the ESL sentences.

Based on the silver-standard annotations from Zhao (2020), we developed a gold-standard version by manually annotating each ESL sentence with an *accept* or *reject* decision, and further refining the syntactic analyses for rejected cases. The updated dataset is described in our paper titled Compositional Syntactico-SemBanking for English as a Second or Foreign Language, which has been accepted for publication at ACL 2025 and should be available online soon.
